all i need to do is to make mind maps for my dsa projects 
so i am ready to do whatever i want and i will for sure succeed at my wok
i know that testing my typing speed is not an important thing at all but is feels good to have a good typing speed and it feels good when u dont look at the key board and type things really fast 
my fucking heart gets excited for no fuking reason helpp
